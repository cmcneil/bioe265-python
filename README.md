# bioe265-python
A python alternative to all of the template code for this class.
Read: [MATLAB Considered Harmful](http://neuroplausible.com/matlab)


Here is all the template code organized by set. See function docstrings for usage, though it should almost always match the MATLAB versions.

## Set 2
All functions found in mriutil.py
`myjinc`, `mysinc`, `fft2c`, `ifft2c`

## Set 4
* For the bloch simulator, use my fork of the Neji [python bloch simulator](https://github.com/cmcneil/bloch-simulator-python). It is valuable for a research project, so it is actively maintained as of (see last commit). I have PRs out on the original neji repo, but it seems to be no longer maintained. Note that the bloch simulator requires cython, and must be run in Python3.
* For bloch spin visualization and animations, use `visualize_mag.py`.

## Set 5
Only data files. In-set code examples should translate more or less line-by-line.

## Set 6
`diff_sim.py` and `t2_sim.py`
